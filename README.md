## Goodreads-UNspoiled

Do you HATE spoilers? Are the 'blurred' spoilers in Goodreads reviews too easy for your brain to decipher? A spoiler tag has ONE. JOB. But for some of us, it's pretty easy to guess what's supposedly hidden behind it. 

Install **GoodReads UNspoiled** and never get accidentally spoiled again. This userstyle significantly increases the blur and width on review spoilers, ensuring a true spoiler-free experience. It effectively obfuscates spoiler text, maintaining the mystery and surprise in your reading journey. 

Perfect for those who want to avoid accidental spoilers while browsing Goodreads:

* Works on: Goodreads reviews with in-text 'blurred lines' spoilers, as seen on Goodreads book pages. 
* Compatible with various Goodreads URL language versions
* Visuals tested for compatibility with both light and dark modes.
* Box shadows added to make it even harder to guess spoilers based on word length. 

**note:** Individual review URLs (those that show a single book review, and begin with https://www.goodreads.com/review/) still use Goodreads' older style of spoiler tagging, and thus don't need any additional blocking.
